It's more preferable to use Chain of responsibility pattern. The reasons are the following:
- the task describes behaviour of request, not structure
- we have "next" (manager) reference
- according to the request every manager entity decides whether to approve it or pass futher

Decoration pattern serves to add additional functionality to classes using composition, not inheritance
